run_analysis.R is the result of the programming assignment of Week 4 for the 
"Getting and Cleaning Data" module of the Coursera Data Science Specialisation offered
by the Johns Hopkins University

The functionality of run_analysis is:

 1.	It merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 2.	It extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
 3.	It uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 4.	It appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
 5.	From the data set in step 4, it creates a second, independent tidy data set with the 
        average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The logic is decribed in the script code, with additional explanation of the variables that are used in this code book. 

Within run_analysis.R the following variables are used. 

Reading the features file to later use in the names for the columns of the total_rundata_set

Variable: features 
This variable is used to store the character strings for the column names. The characters are read from the features.txt file
In line 62, this variable is used to set the column names for the columns of the total_rundata_set. It is only a temporary 
object, in line 76 is is removed to free memory.

Variable: X_train_df
This variable is a data frame. The object is used to store the values read from the X_train.txt file, which contains the 
Samsung training measurements. These measurements are essentially the same kind of measurements, but have been labeled 
'training data ' by the researchers, to enable development of analytical models.

Variable: y_train_df
This variable is a data frame. The object is used to store the values read from the y_train.txt file, which contains the 
activity labels ('walking', 'sitting'etc) for the measurements that are in the X_train_df rows.

Variable: subject_train_df
This variable is a data frame. The object is used to store the values read from the subject_train.txt file, which 
contains the ID's for the testpersons that perform the movements for which the data is in the X_train rows. 

Variable: X_test_df
This variable is a data frame. The object is used to store the values read from the X_test.txt file, which contains the 
Samsung training measurements. Note that these are the same measurements but have been labeled Test to facilitate testing 
of models that have been developed.

Variable: y_test_df
This variable is a data frame. The object is used to store the values read from the y_test.txt file, which contains the 
activity labels ('walking', 'sitting'etc) for the measurements that are in the X_test_df rows.

Variable: subject_test_df
This variable is a data frame. The object is used to store the values read from the subject_test.txt file, which 
contains the ID's for the testpersons that perform the movements for which the data is in the X_test rows. 

In the next steps the training data and test data are bound together in one data frame for the training data and one
data frame for the test data. The dataframes are then combined by rbind. The following variables are used.

Variable: train_df
This variable is used to combine X_train_df, y_train_df and subject_train_df. It is only a temporary variable and is
removed in line 74.  

Variable: test_df 
This variable is used to combine X_test_df, y_test_df and subject_test_df

All variables above are removed from memory in lines 68-75 since they were only temporary. 

Variable: total_rundata_set 
The variable total_rundat_set contains all data that is read from the training and test data files. In line 61-65 the column names are set
In lines 83-95 the activities of the test persons, that are given with integers from 1 to 6 are replaced by characters with the information
from the activity_names.txt file.

Variable: column_index_containing_mean 
This variable is used to contain the values for the columns that have a variable associated with a mean (as required in the
assignment.

Variable: column_index_containing_std                                    
This variable is used to contain the values for the columns that have a variable associated with a standard deviation (std) 
(as required in the assignment).

Variable: selection_of_columns_with_mean_or_std 
This variable is used to combine the results of the columns for mean and std to make the column selection statement in line 108
more compact. 

Variable: all_selected_colums 
This variable is used to add the columns 562 and 563 which contain the ID of the testpersons and the activity name. 

Variable: final_rundata_set 
This variable stores the data that is from measurements associated with a mean and std, as required in the assignment. 
As such it is the final set for steps 1-4. This variable is the basis for the tidy data set (step 5)

Variable: dataMelt 
This variable is used to make a long and narrow data set for tidying the data in step 5. The Unique_ID_of_testperson 
and Activity_of_the_testperson data is sued as ID's and the rest of the data as variable. This enables casting in the 
next step

Variable: vars
The vars temporary object is used to make the statement to generate the tidyDataset more compact
It contains the variable names tBodyAcc-mean()-X to fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-meanFreq()
 
Variable: tidyDataset 
This is the variable that store the tidy data set with the mean of the variabes tBodyAcc-mean()-X to 
fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-meanFreq().
